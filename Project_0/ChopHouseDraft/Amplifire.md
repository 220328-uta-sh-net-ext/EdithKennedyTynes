~Data backup and recovery
~Cost efficient (pay as you go)
~Increased productivity,
~Speed and Efficient
~Performance

~Accessibility (anywhere in the world) and pay per use
~Reliable and availability
~Huge cloud storage
~Automatic software IDs

####Cons
~Good internet connection is required for uploading and downloading
~Downtime-possible outages
~Limited control because the user doesn't own the infrastructure limited control
and access to cloud infrastructure
~A host of services are provided the consumption comes with restrictions
and limited flexibility for apps and developments. Some of these cloud based data storages may be platform
dependent or have what is known as a "vendor lock-in" causing complications for migration.
~Although saving and cost efficient the cost can become an (on-going) monthly expense compared
to traditional methods the initial one time investment.
~Security another drawback is security, and data vulnerability
~Technical issues could pose a problem in which the vendor my not have a 24hr support team
Lastly Vendor lock in
