#Cloud Computing 
the delivery of different services through the internet but are not limited to services. 
Cloud computing includes tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases, \
networking, & software.

Cloud computing is coupled with a cloud based storage, a remote or virtual world(web)
database(stores data and applicable software to keep it running) 

Pros
---------- 
Data control- centralizes data for large projects and branch offices
Data backup and recovery
cost efficient (pay as you go)
increased productivity, 
speed and efficient
performance
security 
declutter
Minimal management 
Accessibility and pay per use 
reliable 
Huge cloud storage 
Automatic software IDs

Con
-----------

~Good internet connection is required for uploading and downloading
~Downtime-possible outages
~because the user doesnt own the infrastucture limited control 
and access to cloud infrastructure 
~A host of services are provided the consumption comes with restrictions 
and limited flexibility for apps and developments. Some of these cloud based data storages may be platform
dependent or have what is known as a "vendor lock-in" causing complications for migration
~Although saving and cost efficient the cost can become an (on-going) monthly expense compared 
to traditional methods the initial one time investment.
~Another drawback is security, and data vulnerability 
~technical issues could pose a problenm in which the vendor my not have a 24hr support team
Lastly Vendor lock in
